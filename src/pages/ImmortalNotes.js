      - Bart is a prototypical trickster (predilection) and thrives in the
      pursuit of outflanking others both physically and mentally whether its
      sprinting on the track course (obsessed with speed) or in the psychology
      office telling others the 'real' reason for their troubles. He actually
      does enjoy helping others reaching their goals, but mostly if he knows it
      is something they will regret. He lives in the clifton area north of
      University of Cincinnati in an older house, 3 bed 1 bath (1 bedroom full
      of mythical items including antique wardrobe from previous incarnation.
      Makes most income from a psychology practice with one other staff
      psychologist. recurring income from royalties of blog about racing / bus
      racing. Legend blend of interest is the 9 tailed fox from korean lore -
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiho (note flavor with blood drain himsati
      nature) and from japanese lore - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune
      (flavor with fire manipulation, more tails reflect more powerful kitsune).
      He has an antique wardrobe gifted to him from previous avatar. Bart was a
      semi-professional bus racer in college before becoming a psychologist.{" "}

      things moving / floating imagery. # 6, 7, 8 on lower level. small door
      between 11 and 7 is left open, lady drives a bright green jaguar. initial
      investigation pre going to library yields handful of murder type activity
      found in the history of the library (150 - 50 years ago) while noone was
      there in closing hours. (ex: strangling, kniving, suicide) suspicious as
      to why people were there in the first place. Ghost-like bird thing
      identified - says friend or foe? - asks us for help, then asks us to feed
      it. Shrieks and chills with cold thermal readings - trying again tomorrow.

    <h3>Game Day 2</h3>
    <p>
      Brad Neimyer - our tech guy. Did not hear words on the voice recording but
      everyone else did. Jessica Duncan also reviewed some video and audio. Was
      skeptical of video - hears growl - but no words on audio footage. Rajeesh
      hypnotized Jessica Duncan - found that Jane Brannigan, library assistant,
      was murdered in 1953 strangled and knived - her head was in the toilet
      when body found. Does she have enemies? Rumors that she was investigating
      an owner of the library. Civil trial was in progress and she died before
      trial. Murderer never found. Research yielded Reginald Osiris - accused of
      abusing / assaulting 20ish 20 year old girls. Predatory sexual processes,
      stories of him using his mercantile prowess to make his fortune. 2 or 3
      different arms of questionable behavior. (allegedly, never convicted)
      Legend of cincinnati strangler that was stalking young wealthy women 22 -
      40, one victim killed in parking lot of the library - killings stopped in
      1960. Owner of library (Reginald) died in 1981. Parking lot victim at the
      library died in 1956. Research indicates not an employee of library. Her
      name was (Derrick to name later) she was a patron of this library. Bart
      Spent 50$ on food. Bart encounters ghost and smacks the doritos out of his
      hand. Potentially drains him of lifeforce as he sleeps on the floor near
      the rune in the floor. Jane Brannigan answers us on the ouji board. Says
      Reginald Probably had her killed, but likely didn't do the dirty work
      himself. Says needs eat eat to restore self. Wants to eat Bart. Owl must
      rest for now, but willing to eat on Rajeesh tomororw. 5:30 a.m. get some
      drunkin banging on the bus? Random person asking us what we're doing here.
      Rajeesh unable to sleep 2 nights in a row spends time at the police
      station to investigate Reginald / cold case of the parking lot murder.
      Reginald was a likely suspect in cincinnati strangler case. Rajeesh bribes
      Jessica Duncan with $8,000 check to buy a few more days in the libary -
      also obtains a membership to the library. Bart struggling to get back to
      normal after ghost fed on him. Owl takes multiple feedings of Rajeesh and
      says "THANK YOU" and goes back underground. Eventually OWL bursts out of
      ventilation system, seems to turn into women, who runs out of building and
      then turns into owl and flies over the building. Rajeesh uses remaining
      budget to call emergency repair man to fix the furnace system we destroyed
      to free the owl. everyone gets 8 exp, mike gets 1 extra point. What do we
      want to include in the show? What do we want to exclude. no footage of
      last 2 nights of feeding or lady turning to bird and flying away. 1 day
      afterward - Rajeesh is out of comission. How do we rationalize what we
      saw, and how does that affect us. Picking up next week at the lounge.

    <h3>Game Day 3</h3>
    <p>

      strip club. Ice Queen lady stripper Naomi - stage name Lanfear - has
      strange tattoos that are very lively. Bart has waitress slip E into
      Rajeesh's drink after already seeming to experience extra-ordinary sensory
      experiences. Rajeesh shows the team his lizard eyes. Rajeesh feeling very
      good after a second round of "drinks" for the group, attempts to perform
      magic tricks on an empty stage before a finale of bending foward and going
      85% crocodile. Suddenly Rajeesh is being pulled toward the back of the
      club. Lanfear encourages rajeesh discreetly that he should not do that in
      public. Rajeesh insists upon Bart getting a massage, Lanfear has furry
      hands and seems to have claws. Rajeesh can control his himsati now.
      Homework: pick one of the other two leads we have. We have Naomi as a
      resource now. Her role is to help us figure things out.

      lodging for the investigation). Paranormal activities seem isolated to the
      bottom 2 floors. Areas of reports - Bar area, Spa area. Naomi gives
      rajeesh advice to cure the draining we can drain the essence of others.
      Nautilus and Rajeesh know how to shift into animal form now. Bart whiffs a

      sex will help cure the drained feelings.
